# asktoby.php
asktoby.php is a Lightweight Search Engine Meant to be Simple Enough for Novices to Build on a  Single Managed Virtual Private Server from GoDaddy or HostGator. NOTE: I'm currently working on Version 3 of asktoby.php, but it is not yet complete. So the code that you see here is not complete. However, versions 1 and 2 are complete, so feel free to check them out under the "releases" tab.
